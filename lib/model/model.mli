(** This file provides {!Model.Make} which encapsulates everything necessary for the {b OCaml} models {i (i.e., with no {b Rocq} terms)}. This is unlike {!Mebi_plugin.Graph} that is used when building an initial model of {b Rocq} and then extracting it into a pure {b OCaml} model, using {!Encoding}.

  (** {2 Product} *)

  (** {!Product} provides {!val:Product.respond}: the simulation game's
      response choice, i.e. which state the right-hand FSM must move to when
      the left-hand one has made a labelled move. This is the decision the
      proof solver takes at every step; it lives here because it is pure
      model code, and because everything that needs it must {b call} it
      rather than reproduce it. *)
