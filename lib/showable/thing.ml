(* Unifies [Showable]'s pp/show/equal/compare with [Json.S]'s
   json/to_string/log/write, so a component supplies {name; json; equal;
   compare} once instead of separately hand-writing equal/compare and
   calling [Json.Thing.Make]. [pp]/[show] are derived from the existing
   [json] function (via [to_string]) rather than requiring a second,
   independently-written pretty-printer per component. *)

(** A component of the model: printable, ordered, and with JSON. *)
module type S = sig
  type t

  include Showable.Ordered with type t := t
  include Json.S with type k := t
end

(* The result deliberately introduces no [type t]/[type k] of its own --
   every value is phrased directly in terms of [X.t]. An ascription like
   ": S with type t = X.t" would still hide [X.t]'s field/constructor labels
   from callers (S declares [type t] abstractly; a manifest equation on an
   otherwise-abstract name doesn't reveal what's behind it), forcing a
   record type declared via [Thing.Make] to be unusable with its own field
   syntax ([x.base]). Naming [X.t] directly sidesteps the issue: nothing
   here ever needs its own name for the type, so nothing is hidden. *)

(** [Make (X)] is {!S} for [X.t], from its name, JSON, equality and order:
    [show] is its JSON on one line, and [pp] prints that. *)

  end) : sig
  (* Kept (not eliminated, unlike [t]) so a component can still be passed
     directly as a Key/Value argument to [Json.Map.Make] (e.g. for a
     Hashtbl-based component elsewhere) -- nothing ever field-accesses
     through [k], so exposing it under its own name is safe. *)

(** [Set (X) (N)] is the set of [X]s, printable ({!Showable.Set}) and with

    format names a set differently from its element (e.g. "States", not
    "State"). *)
