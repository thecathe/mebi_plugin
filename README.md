# MEBI: Mechanised Bisimilarities

This repository contains a Coq plugin for automating bisimilarity proofs (which are currently taken from the methods detailed in "Advanced Topics in Bisimulation and Coinduction", Section 3.2.2).


**Work in progress**

## Building the Project

### Toolchain
Built against **Rocq 9.2** (`rocq-core` 9.2.0, `rocq-runtime` 9.2.0, `rocq-stdlib` 9.1.0), OCaml 5.4.0 and dune 3.23, in a **local opam switch** (`_opam/` in the project root).

Versions are pinned in two places, and both are committed:
- **`flake.nix` / `flake.lock`** — nix pins the system layer: `opam` itself, `pkg-config`, `gmp`, `zlib`, `git`, `make` and the C toolchain.
- **`rocq-mebi.opam.locked`** — opam pins the OCaml/Rocq layer: every one of the ~100 packages at an exact version, including `rocq-core.9.2.0`, `rocq-stdlib.9.1.0` and `ocaml-base-compiler.5.4.0`.

The ranges the source is *known* to compile in live in `dune-project`'s `(depends ...)`; the lockfile records one exact solution inside those ranges. `rocq-mebi.opam` is generated from `dune-project` by dune and is committed — it is the input to `opam switch create`, so a clone cannot bootstrap without it.

### First-time setup on a new machine
```shell
git clone https://github.com/dcastrop/mebi_plugin && cd mebi_plugin
direnv allow                     # or: nix develop
opam switch create . --locked --deps-only
opam install . --locked --deps-only --with-dev-setup
```
The dev shell notices when `_opam/` is missing and prints this command; run it under `nix develop` in a terminal and it offers to do it for you. Expect it to take a while — it builds OCaml 5.4.0 and Rocq from source.

`--with-dev-setup` is what pulls in `ocaml-lsp-server`, `ocamlformat` and `vsrocq-language-server`. Drop it if you only want to build.

> **Run these inside the dev shell.** It sets `OPAMNODEPEXTS=1`. Without it, opam probes the system package manager for `gmp` and `pkg-config`, doesn't find them (nix supplies them, not the system), and offers to run `nix-build` — which aborts the bootstrap. Outside the shell, pass `--no-depexts` by hand.

### Everyday environment
With `direnv`, entering the directory is enough. Without it:
```shell
nix develop
eval $(opam env --switch=$(pwd) --set-switch)
```
Check it took: `rocq --version` should report 9.2, and `which dune` should point inside `_opam/bin`.

### Changing dependencies
Edit the `(depends ...)` ranges in `dune-project`, then regenerate both files:
```shell
dune build rocq-mebi.opam        # dune-project -> rocq-mebi.opam
opam lock .                      # -> rocq-mebi.opam.locked
```
Commit both. Bumping `rocq-core`'s upper bound is a deliberate act — the plugin links against `rocq-runtime`'s OCaml API, which breaks across Rocq *minor* versions.

### Two build paths

**`dune build`** — the plugin (`src/`, `lib/`) and `theories/`. This is the everyday build.
```shell
dune build
```

**`make`** — the same, *plus* the `examples/` listed in `_CoqProject`. Use it when you want the examples checked.
```shell
make -j$(nproc)
```
`_CoqProject` deliberately enables only a subset of `examples/**/*.v`; the rest are commented out with a note on why (proof explosion, long compile). Comment lines back in to build more.

### Switching back to dune after running make
```shell
make dune
```
`make` writes generated files into the source tree (`src/g_mebi.ml`, `*.vo`, `*.glob`, `*.cm*`). Dune also claims those paths, so a following `dune build` fails with `Multiple rules generated ...`. Dune has no way to ignore them, so the artifacts have to go: `make dune` is just `make clean && dune build`.

### Faster inner loops
A full `dune build` takes ~1m40s, almost all of it the `MeBi Benchmark` vernaculars in `theories/DevTest.v`. When you don't need them:

| Changing | Command |
| --- | --- |
| OCaml plugin code | `dune build @check` — type-checks everything in `lib/` and `src/`, builds no `.vo` (~2s) |
| OCaml, and you want the loadable plugin | `dune build src/` |
| A single theory file | `dune build theories/Test.vo` |
| Everything, before committing | `dune build` |

`dune build @check` also produces the `.cmi`/`.cmt` files merlin needs, so it doubles as the "make my editor happy" command.

### Running tests
`dune exec test/tests.exe` runs a small pure-OCaml test suite (no Rocq runtime) exercising `lib/model` directly — FSM construction, saturation, minimization, bisimilarity, JSON round-tripping. It's a fast first signal for changes to `lib/model`/`lib/terms`/`lib/utils`, but it doesn't exercise the proof solver (`src/proof_solver*`) or anything Rocq-facing.

The only end-to-end coverage of the proof solver is the `examples/Bisimilarity/**/PluginProofs.v` files, which are commented out of `_CoqProject` by default (full proof search is slow — some examples need tens of thousands of tactic iterations). Uncomment the ones you need and run `make -j$(nproc)` to exercise them; see the comment next to each line in `_CoqProject` for which are cheap vs. expensive.



### Using VSCode
Use the **[VsRocq extension](https://github.com/rocq-prover/vsrocq)**; `vsrocqtop` is installed in the local switch. Rebuild before reloading the window, since the extension loads the compiled plugin.

`.vscode/settings.json` is set up for the local switch already. The important part:
```json
"ocaml.sandbox": { "kind": "opam", "switch": "${workspaceFolder}" }
```
A **local** switch is identified by its full path, so `${workspaceFolderBasename}` does *not* work — opam reads a bare name as a *global* switch and reports `The selected switch mebi_plugin is not installed`.

The OCaml editor tooling lives in the switch too:
```shell
opam install ocaml-lsp-server ocamlformat
```

#### Issues with `vsrocqtop`
If VSCode is launched outside the direnv environment it won't have `_opam/bin` on `PATH`. Point it at the binary explicitly:
```json
"vsrocq.path": "${workspaceFolder}/_opam/bin/vsrocqtop"
```

> Access this file by pressing **`ctrl+,`** and then clicking the file icon button in the top right corner, which will open the settings as a `json` file.





## Usage

Every command below starts with `MeBi` and needs `Require Import MEBI.loader.` first. This is the current command surface — see `src/g_mebi.mlg` for the exact grammar, and `theories/Test.v`/`theories/DevTest.v` for more worked examples.

### Building an LTS or FSM

```
MeBi Run LTS <term> Using <relation> [<relation>...].
MeBi Run FSM <term> Using <relation> [<relation>...].
```

`<relation>` must be an inductive relation of type `Term -> Label -> Term -> Prop` describing `<term>`'s transitions; any further `<relation>`s let mebi unfold auxiliary definitions it needs while exploring. `Run LTS` builds the labelled transition system as-is; `Run FSM` additionally deduplicates into a finite state machine. Example:

```coq
Inductive testLTS : nat -> bool -> nat -> Prop :=
  | test1 n : testLTS (S n) true n
  | test2 : testLTS (S 0) false (S 0).

MeBi Run LTS 0 Using testLTS.
```

### Bisimilarity, merging, minimizing, saturating

```
MeBi Run Bisim <term> With <relation> And <term> With <relation> [Using <relation>...].
MeBi Run Merge <term> With <relation> And <term> With <relation> [Using <relation>...].
MeBi Run Minimize <term> Using <relation> [<relation>...].
MeBi Run Saturate <term> Using <relation> [<relation>...].
```

`Run Bisim` checks (weak, if `Config Weak` is set — see below) bisimilarity between the two terms' LTSs. `Run Merge` combines two FSMs into one. `Run Minimize` partition-refines an FSM down to its bisimulation quotient. `Run Saturate` computes weak transitions across silent (tau) steps.

### Which constructor shapes are supported

An LTS is an inductive relation `term -> label -> term -> Prop`. For each constructor, mebi matches the source term and then handles its premises:

- **Premises over an LTS listed in `Using`** (the LTS itself, or another one: layered LTSs) are explored, and a constructor may have several. The proof search replays every premise's derivation.
- **Equations `l = r`** are decided once both sides are closed. Sides fixed by matching the source term are decided immediately; sides fixed only by the constructor's LTS premises (a label, say) are decided after those are solved. Convertible sides hold, and a difference in constructors means the premise fails, so that transition is not in the LTS. In a proof, such premises are closed by `reflexivity`.
- **Anything else** (an equation over terms that do not reduce, other propositions) cannot be decided. The constructor is applied as if the premise held, with a warning, so the LTS may contain transitions that do not exist. A `Run Bisim` verdict on such an LTS may be wrong, but a proof cannot be: `Qed` still checks the premise.

### Benchmarking

```
MeBi Benchmark LTS <min-size> <max-size> <term> Using <relation> [<relation>...].
```

Times repeated LTS construction over a range of sizes using the `benchmark` package.

### Interactive proof search (`MeBi Sim`)

Inside a proof whose goal is bisimilarity-shaped (e.g. `weak_sim r1 r2 t1 t2`), `MeBi Sim` drives a tactic-based proof-search state machine instead of writing the proof by hand:

```coq
Example wsim_pq : weak_sim termLTS termLTS p q.
Proof.
  MeBi Sim Begin termLTS p And termLTS q Using termLTS.
  MeBi Sim Solve 114.
Qed.
```

`Sim Begin <relation> <term> And <relation> <term> [Using <relation>...]` starts the search for the current goal. `Sim Step.` runs a single step. `Sim Solve <bound>.` runs up to `<bound>` steps, stopping as soon as the goal is proved — the bound just needs to be an upper limit, not an exact count (see the worked examples under `examples/Bisimilarity/**/PluginProofs.v` for real bound values, which vary widely by example size).

### Configuration

```
MeBi Config Reset [Bounds|Weak|FailIf|Output].
MeBi Config Bounds As Num States <n>.
MeBi Config Bounds As Num Transitions <n>.
MeBi Config Bounds Saturation <n>.
MeBi Config Weak As Option <term>.
MeBi Config Weak As <term> Of <relation>.
MeBi Config Weak1 / Weak2 As Option <term>.        (* set only the first/second side of a Bisim/Merge/Sim check *)
MeBi Config Weak1 / Weak2 As <term> Of <relation>.
MeBi Config FailIf Empty/Incomplete/NotBisimilar/Oversaturated True/False.
MeBi Config Output "<Kind>" True/False.
```

- `Bounds` caps how large an explored graph may get before mebi gives up. Extraction has measured 0.01–0.07MB of memory per state on top of a fixed ~0.1–0.3GB, so setting a state bound whose upper estimate passes 1GB (about 14,000 states) prints a notice. Logging the result with `Output "Result"`/`"DecodeResults"`/`"DumpResults"` costs far more, about 0.65MB per state, because every term is pretty-printed.
- `Bounds Saturation <n>` caps how many weak actions saturation (used by `Saturate`, `Minimize`, `Bisim` and `Sim Begin` whenever a `Weak` label is set) may produce. Saturation can be orders of magnitude larger than the LTS: `examples/Bisimilarity/Proc/Test4` has 9720 states and would saturate to 74.6M weak actions. Before saturating, mebi computes that number exactly (cheaply, without saturating) and refuses above the bound with `Saturation_Too_Large`, naming the figure. The default is 1,000,000. Measured memory is 450–900 bytes per weak action, the upper end for larger LTSs (each action keeps its shortest witness path). Pick a bound your machine can hold. As a guide:

  | `<n>` (weak actions) | approx. memory |
  | -------------------- | -------------- |
  | 1,000,000 (default)  | 0.45–0.9 GB    |
  | 5,000,000            | 2.3–4.5 GB     |
  | 10,000,000           | 4.5–9 GB       |
  | 20,000,000           | 9–18 GB        |

  Time grows faster than linearly in the count (a partial `Test4` LTS with 400k weak actions takes ~13s), so a large bound can also mean a long wait. The proof examples (`PluginProofs.v`) saturate to at most a few hundred weak actions. Run `MeBi Config Output "Info" True.` to see each estimate.
- `Weak` (and the asymmetric `Weak1`/`Weak2`) mark a label constructor as the silent/tau action, enabling weak bisimilarity/saturation. `Reset Weak` clears it back to strong bisimilarity.
- `FailIf` controls whether an empty LTS, an incomplete (unboundedly large) exploration, a negative bisimilarity result, or a saturation above `Bounds Saturation` raises a hard error instead of a warning. `Oversaturated` defaults to `True`, because past the bound the likely alternative is running out of memory. `False` warns and saturates anyway.
- `Output "<Kind>" <bool>` toggles one log channel. `<Kind>` is one of `Debug`, `Info`, `Notice`, `Warning`, `Error`, `Trace`, `Result`, `Show`, `DecodeResults`, `DumpResults`.

Print a message/debug line, or a visual divider (with an optional label) — useful for finding your place in a large build log.

> `MeBi Help` is declared in `src/g_mebi.mlg` but currently disabled (it prints a placeholder message); there is no in-plugin help text yet.





## Status & Remaining Work

The core functionality described under [Usage](#usage) — reading a `Step : Term -> Label -> Term -> Prop`-shaped relation, building an LTS/FSM from a term, deciding (weak) bisimilarity, and turning the result into a Rocq proof via `MeBi Sim` — is implemented and working. Remaining work (algorithmic gaps like a similarity-only algorithm, proof-solver performance on larger examples, and project-structure/tooling debt such as CI and packaging metadata) is tracked in [`TODO.md`](TODO.md).
