  (** This step's own monad/encoding stack, separate from the command-time one.

      Separate because the two read different [env]/[sigma]: this one the goal,
      the command-time one the global environment. [Bi_encoding] hashes its
      [EConstr.t] keys under whichever it is given, so one table cannot serve
      both -- entries would go in under one [sigma] and be looked up under the
      other.

      Nothing is lost by not sharing. The lookups that have to hit the model --
      [ReModel.state] and [ReModel.label] in [Proof_solver_step] -- go through
      the command-time [W.M] and always did. This table only ever backs [encode]
      / [econstr_compare] / [EConstrSet] below, all of which are per-step by
      construction. *)

  (* Installed once, here, rather than per [I.run]: see [Bi_encoding.set_ctx].

  (** [EConstrSet] is a custom [Set] of [EConstr.t] that allows terms to be
      compared more efficiently during {b a single proof step only}. Since each
      proof step gets a new [env] and [sigma] (a fresh [module Iter], and with
      it a fresh [EConstrSet], is created on every call to {!Proof_solver.step}
      -- see [make]/[step] there), the same underlying term may encode
      differently across steps, so an [EConstrSet.t] built in one step is not
      meaningful to compare against one built in another.

      {b Audited 2026-09-27:} no call site does this. Every use
      ([Proof_solver_tactics.collect_component_econstrs]/[try_unfold_any])
      builds, consumes and discards an [EConstrSet.t] within a single function
      call, and no persistent state type ([Proof_solver_statem.S],
      [Proof_solver.t]) ever stores one. This holds structurally, not by
      convention: the whole module tree containing [EConstrSet] is torn down and
      rebuilt fresh each step, so a value could not survive to the next step
      even if something tried to stash it. If a future change introduces a call
      site that returns or stores an [EConstrSet.t] outside of one step's local
      computation, that would break this invariant and needs the same scrutiny
      this comment once flagged. *)
